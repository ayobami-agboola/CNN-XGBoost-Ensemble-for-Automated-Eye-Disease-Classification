# CNN-XGBoost-Ensemble-for-Automated-Eye-Disease-Classification
Intend to develop and evaluate a novel CNN-XGBoost ensemble model for automated diagnosis of eye diseases, specifically targeting the classification of healthy eyes, glaucoma, myopia, and disc edema conditions


Eye diseases including glaucoma, myopia, and disc edema represent significant global health challenges. The shortage of ophthalmologists, particularly in developing regions, necessitates innovative diagnostic solutions. This study presents a novel hybrid ensemble system combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost for automated eye disease diagnosis from retinal fundus images.
The research aimed to develop an ensemble model leveraging CNN's feature extraction capabilities with XGBoost's classification efficiency. Key objectives included designing a ResNet50V2-based CNN with attention mechanisms for feature extraction, developing an XGBoost classifier utilizing CNN-extracted features, creating an optimally weighted ensemble system, and comprehensively evaluating model performance.
The dataset comprised 127 original fundus images per class across four categories;  glaucoma, myopia, disc edema, and healthy eyes. Data augmentation expanded the training set to 1,000 images per class. The CNN architecture incorporated ResNet50V2 with channel attention and dual-pooling strategies, trained using a two-phase approach with focal loss. XGBoost was trained on the CNN-extracted features with Bayesian-optimized hyperparameters. The ensemble combined predictions using 60% CNN and 40% XGBoost weights.
Results demonstrated robust performance. The CNN achieved 77.50% accuracy (MCC: 0.7015, Kappa: 0.7000) with exceptional glaucoma detection (100% recall). XGBoost improved to 78.75% accuracy (MCC: 0.7189, Kappa: 0.7167), maintained by the ensemble. Per-class F1-scores showed strong performance for glaucoma (0.9756) and healthy eyes (0.8108), with moderate results for disc edema (0.6842) and myopia (0.6818). ROC analysis yielded AUC values from 0.779 to 0.998, indicating excellent discriminative ability.
This work contributes to the growing field of AI-assisted medical diagnosis by presenting a practical, accurate, and computationally feasible solution for automated eye disease screening, with particular potential for deployment in resource-limited settings.
